This folder contains a sample graphics app using littleVGL library and libbsd
The generated exe file can be directly run using a JTAG debugger on a target
with the right device tree or this can be converted into an image.

For instructions on how to build the image or how to run the exe, please refer
to the BSP documentation in https://docs.rtems.org
